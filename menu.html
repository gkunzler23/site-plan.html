      Navigating this site is simple. First create a username and password to create an account.<br>
      This will make it easier for you as the user and the restaurant to see the same user.<br> 
      This will also provide you as the user the ability to save your payment information to save<br>
      you extra time as well. Whether on our app or on our website you will be asked to allow <br>
      Triple Threat to see your location in order to give local restaurants near you. <br><br>
      Triple Threat covers more than just one restaurant. It gives you multiple options to choose from.<br> 
      Many restaurants have loved partnering with Triple Threat because it saves their employees time from<br> 
      taking reservations over the phone and gives them plenty of time to have each reservations food <br>
      prepared in a timely manner. Triple Threat has given an easier way of enjoying a stress free evening out.<br><br> 
      WARNING!! Know that this is a first come, first serve experience! Those that reserve ahead of time for their<br> 
      desired restaurant and seating arrangement will be expected to be there at the time reserved.<br> 
      To avoid cancelations and inconveniencing the restaurant, you as the user will be expected to pay a<br> 
      $10 deposit for the time slot selected. If your party is running late and arrive 15 minutes later than<br> 
      the scheduled reservation, you will forfeit your deposit as well as your reservation so that the restaurant<br> 
      can make room for the next reservation.<br>
