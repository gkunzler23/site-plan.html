      Here are the 3 things you can use on our website to better plan your evening:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>-	Reservation! Instead of waiting to speak to someone over the phone,<br>
          you can click on the reservation tab at the restaurant of your choosing <br>
          and see what seating is available and would fit a group of your size.<br>
          Click to reserve and experience a quick seating upon your arrival.<br>
        </li>
        <li>-	Order ahead! See the full menu of the restaurant of your choosing<br>
          and order ahead of time. Enjoy a nice meal at the time you are seated.<br>
        </li>
        <li>-	What Restaurants are busy? Restaurants in your local area on this<br>
          website will be color coded according to the number of reservations.<br>
          Green will show a not so busy restaurant, Yellow will be moderately<br>
          busy, and Red will be very busy. This will help you in your decision<br>
          making of which restaurant to attend.
        </li>
    </ol>
