        Here are the 3 things you can use on our website to better plan your evening:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>-	Reservation! Instead of waiting to speak to someone over the phone,<br>
            you can click on the reservation tab at the restaurant of your choosing <br>
            and see what seating is available and would fit a group of your size.<br>
            Click to reserve and experience a quick seating upon your arrival.<br>
          </li>
          <li>-	Order ahead! See the full menu of the restaurant of your choosing<br>
            and order ahead of time. Enjoy a nice meal at the time you are seated.<br>
          </li>
          <li>-	What Restaurants are busy? Restaurants in your local area on this<br>
            website will be color coded according to the number of reservations.<br>
            Green will show a not so busy restaurant, Yellow will be moderately<br>
            busy, and Red will be very busy. This will help you in your decision<br>
            making of which restaurant to attend.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Navigating this site is simple. First create a username and password to create an account.<br>
        This will make it easier for you as the user and the restaurant to see the same user.<br> 
        This will also provide you as the user the ability to save your payment information to save<br>
        you extra time as well. Whether on our app or on our website you will be asked to allow <br>
        Triple Threat to see your location in order to give local restaurants near you. <br><br>
        Triple Threat covers more than just one restaurant. It gives you multiple options to choose from.<br> 
        Many restaurants have loved partnering with Triple Threat because it saves their employees time from<br> 
        taking reservations over the phone and gives them plenty of time to have each reservations food <br>
        prepared in a timely manner. Triple Threat has given an easier way of enjoying a stress free evening out.<br><br> 
        WARNING!! Know that this is a first come, first serve experience! Those that reserve ahead of time for their<br> 
        desired restaurant and seating arrangement will be expected to be there at the time reserved.<br> 
        To avoid cancelations and inconveniencing the restaurant, you as the user will be expected to pay a<br> 
        $10 deposit for the time slot selected. If your party is running late and arrive 15 minutes later than<br> 
        the scheduled reservation, you will forfeit your deposit as well as your reservation so that the restaurant<br> 
        can make room for the next reservation.<br>
